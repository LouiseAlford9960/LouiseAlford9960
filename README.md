## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to exploring token-based authentication and securing backend systems using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This space is where I document my learning, implementation patterns, and best practices related to user authentication, authorization, and secure API development.

As a backend developer, Iâ€™m particularly focused on understanding how modern web applications can authenticate users in a stateless, scalable way. JWTs have become a popular solution for managing secure access, especially in distributed systems, microservices, and single-page applications (SPAs). My goal is to build reliable authentication flows that are both user-friendly and resistant to common security threats.

This repository includes hands-on projects and code samples demonstrating core concepts like login flows, token generation, access and refresh token handling, token storage, and role-based access control (RBAC). Iâ€™m also exploring token expiration strategies, secure cookie usage, and best practices for protecting routes and resources from unauthorized access.

Beyond just writing functional code, I aim to understand the underlying principles of secure authenticationâ€”how tokens work under the hood, common vulnerabilities like token leakage or replay attacks, and how to mitigate them through proper implementation. Documentation and comments are provided throughout each project to support learning and reusability.

Whether youâ€™re just getting started with JWTs or looking to compare implementation strategies across different frameworks (such as Express.js, Flask, or FastAPI), I hope you find value in this work. Feedback, improvements, and discussions are always welcome, as I'm continually evolving my knowledge and refining these solutions.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to explore, fork, or contribute as we build more secure and scalable authentication systems together.
